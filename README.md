# ordering-store-app
This project Burger-Ordering app is part of my asignment from scrimba.com to depict my learning curve on core javascripts methods/attributes (eg forEach, for of, formData, dataset, eventListeners, styles on js etc ) and how to utilize them in my project.

I created this project to depict what I have learnt so far from module 5 works, which is part of my part to become a FrontEnd (ReactJs) Developer.

I used HTML, JS and CSS on this minimalistic burger ordering app. 

Kindly take your time and go through it.
